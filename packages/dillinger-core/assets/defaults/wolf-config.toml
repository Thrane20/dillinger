# Wolf Moonlight Streaming Configuration Template
# This file is used as a template by Dillinger runners when starting Wolf
# See: https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/
#
# The entrypoint.sh script will generate the actual config.toml based on this
# template, substituting environment variables like $GAME_TITLE and $WOLF_UUID.
#
# Paired clients are persisted across sessions via the volume mount.

# Server identification
hostname = "Dillinger"

# Enable HEVC (H.265) encoding for better quality at lower bitrates
support_hevc = true

# Configuration version (Wolf internal)
config_version = 2

# Unique server identifier - generated on first run
# uuid = "auto-generated"

# Paired Moonlight clients
# This section is automatically populated when clients pair via PIN
# Format:
# [[paired_clients]]
# client_cert = "..."
# app_state_folder = "/etc/wolf/..."
paired_clients = []

# Default application profile
# The entrypoint script will generate the [[apps]] section dynamically
# based on the game being launched.
#
# Example generated app:
# [[apps]]
# title = "Game Name"
# start_virtual_compositor = true
#
# For direct game launching (embedded Wolf mode), the runner IS the app,
# so we don't need Docker runner configuration in the config file.
