# Tasks: Game Library Manager

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-game-library-manager/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification, so they are omitted per speckit.tasks guidelines.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md structure: pnpm workspace monorepo with `packages/{shared,backend,frontend}`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Add Game**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1) - Launch Game**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 games but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Browse/Organize**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 games but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Cross-Platform**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1/US3 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services (shared data structures)
- Services before controllers (business logic before API)
- Controllers before routes (implementation before integration)
- Backend API before frontend components (data layer before UI)
- Components before pages (reusable UI before page assembly)
- Core implementation before navigation integration

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel (different entities)
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel (different UI components)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Game entity model in packages/backend/src/models/game.ts"
Task: "Create Platform entity model in packages/backend/src/models/platform.ts"

# Launch all frontend components for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create add game form component in packages/frontend/components/add-game-form.tsx"
Task: "Create platform selector component in packages/frontend/components/platform-selector.tsx"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Add Game to Library)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Launch Game Session)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test that users can add games and launch them
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Basic game management)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP with game launching!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Full library management)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Advanced cross-platform features)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Add games)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Launch games) 
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Browse/organize)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Cross-platform)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Success Criteria Mapping

Each user story maps to specific success criteria from spec.md:

- **User Story 1**: SC-001 (5min game addition), SC-005 (90% metadata retrieval), SC-010 (large library handling)
- **User Story 2**: SC-002 (30s launch time), SC-004 (30fps streaming), SC-007 (clean container lifecycle)
- **User Story 3**: SC-003 (1000+ game performance), SC-008 (browser responsiveness)
- **User Story 4**: SC-012 (multi-platform management from functional requirements)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- JSON storage architecture eliminates database setup complexity
- Docker container management is core to game execution functionality
- Games on Whales/Wolf integration provides desktop streaming capability
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All file paths use the monorepo structure from plan.md
