## 🏗️ Architecture

Dillinger is built as a modern monorepo with the following structure:

```
dillinger/
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/          # Shared TypeScript types and utilities
│   ├── backend/         # Express.js API server
│   └── frontend/        # Next.js web application
├── docker/              # Docker configurations and compose files
├── data/                # JSON-based data storage (development)
└── docs/                # Documentation and guides
```

### Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- **Node.js 18+** with **TypeScript 5.x**
- **Express.js** for REST API
- **JSON File Storage** (development) / **PostgreSQL** (production)
- **Docker Integration** for game containerization
- **WebSocket** support for real-time updates

**Frontend:**
- **Next.js 14+** with **App Router**
- **React 18** with **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive styling
- **SWR** for data fetching and caching
- **React Hook Form** for form management

**Infrastructure:**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for containerization
- **pnpm Workspaces** for monorepo management
- **Games on Whales** for desktop streaming
- **Linux-first** with cross-platform support

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **pnpm 8+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Linux** (recommended) or **macOS/Windows** with WSL2

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thrane20/dillinger.git
   cd dillinger
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build shared packages:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build:shared
   ```

4. **Start development servers:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001
   - Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

### Docker Development

For a complete containerized development environment:

```bash
# Start all services with Docker Compose
pnpm run docker:dev

# Stop all services
pnpm run docker:down
```

## 📚 Usage

### Adding Your First Game

1. **Navigate to "Add Game"** in the web interface
2. **Select a game file** or provide a path to your game executable
3. **Choose a platform** (Steam, Epic, Local, Emulator, etc.)
4. **Configure metadata** (title, genre, tags, artwork)
5. **Save** and the game will appear in your library

### Launching Games

1. **Browse your library** on the homepage
2. **Click "Play"** on any game card
3. **Wait for container startup** (first launch takes longer)
4. **Game streams** directly to your browser with full desktop access
5. **Play using** keyboard, mouse, or connected controllers

### Managing Collections

1. **Create collections** to organize games by genre, mood, or any criteria
2. **Drag and drop** games between collections
3. **Use collections** for quick filtering and discovery

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm run dev              # Start both frontend and backend
pnpm run dev:backend      # Start only backend API server
pnpm run dev:frontend     # Start only frontend dev server

# Building
pnpm run build            # Build all packages
pnpm run build:shared     # Build shared package only

# Testing & Quality
